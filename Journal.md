# Project Journal – Ultrasensitive Electroscope

This journal documents my progress, decisions, experiments, and learnings while building an ultrasensitive electroscope.

# Day 1 – Project Idea & Research

## Thursday 8 January,2025

 What I did
- Researched traditional electroscopes and their limitations
- Studied ultrasensitive electroscope designs and physics principles


 Why
I wanted to build a device capable of detecting extremely weak electric charges for advanced physics experiments and learning.

What I learned
- Sensitivity is strongly affected by mass, insulation, and air currents
- Charge leakage is a major limiting factor

 ### Time Spent: 3 hours

 # Day 2 – Design & Materials
 
## Friday 9 Jan,2025

What I did
- Identifying the gaps and weaknesses in the last version : Low Accuracy - LCD wasn't efficient - High noise 
- Selected insulating materials to minimize charge loss
- Sketched the mechanical layout

Challenges
- Balancing mechanical stability with high sensitivity

 What I learned
- Even small increases in mass significantly reduce responsiveness

 ### Time Spent: 2 Hours

 # Day 3 – Development 
## Saturday 10 Jan,2025

 What I did
- Searching more about Op-Ampilifiers and their types, specifically: Rail to rail. 
- Making the list of other materials needed. 
- Buying new materials: 
* Atmega32P
* 2 Bread boards
* Jumpers
* Resistors
* Ceramic Capacitor
* 2 9V batteries & battery holders
* LCD 16*2
* GS6002-SRNCP6002 Op Amp
* Step down 

Why?
- The old op amp used wasn't rail to rail; so, the readings were random. 
- LCD wasn't good for displaying the Charge every 0.5 second
### Time spent: 4 hours

# Day 4 – Designing the new circuit 
## Sunday 11 Jan,2025
What I did
- Making a new Schematic diagram 
- Applying the new circuit in real life 
- testing the new prototype 

Results
- Noticeable increase in sensitivity
- More stable readings
- Prototype is affected mostly by the Enviromental conditions 

### Time Spent: 6 hours

 # Day 5 - Improving the accuracy and environmetal stability
 ## Monday 12 Jan, 2025

What I did
- Searching more about Isolation systems and possible materials can be used. 
- Making 3d Design of the isolation box, which is made from Aclyric sheets. 
- Searching more about types of probes to increase the accuracy of the device
- Making a mew probe in a double circular shape sandwitch, made from aluminum foil. 
Results:
- Noticeable increase in sensitivity
-  More stable readings

### Time Spent: 4 hours
